129963,Israel,"A bouquet of black cherry, tart cranberry and clove opens into flavors of cherry, anisette, espresso bean and mint, with a hint of tart cranberry. The minty notes can almost seem overly strong for a moment, but tart tones bring the fruit flavors back to the foreground. The pleasantly gripping tannins will mellow with a few more years of aging.",Oak Aged,90,20.0,Galilee,,,Mike DeSimone,@worldwineguys,Dalton 2012 Oak Aged Cabernet Sauvignon (Galilee),Cabernet Sauvignon,Dalton
129964,France,"Initially quite muted, this wine slowly develops impressive richness and spice. It's not sweet, more medium dry, with the spice forming a core of dryness that contrasts with the honeyed texture.

129967,US,"Citation is given as much as a decade of bottle age prior to release, which means it is pre-cellared and drinking at its peak.
